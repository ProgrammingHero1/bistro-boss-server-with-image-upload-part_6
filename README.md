## What We Learn Today

### Why We Use React-Query, Axios, and React Hook Form
- **React-Query**: Simplifies data fetching and state management, providing caching, synchronization, and background updates to enhance user experience and performance.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client that makes it easier to make requests to the server, handle responses, and manage errors compared to the native `fetch` API.
- **React Hook Form**: Provides a flexible and efficient way to handle form inputs, validations, and submission, reducing boilerplate code and improving performance with minimal re-renders.
